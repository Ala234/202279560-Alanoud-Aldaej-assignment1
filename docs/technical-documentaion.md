# Technical Documentation  
Personal Portfolio Assignment

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a front-end personal portfolio website developed to present my academic background, technical skills, and completed projects in a clear and organized way.  

The website is implemented as a static web application that runs entirely on the client side without requiring any backend services or database integration.

The main objective of this assignment is to practice structuring a front-end project, applying UI/UX design principles, and adding interactive features using JavaScript.

## 2. Project Scope

- Front-end development only  
- Technologies used:
  - **HTML** for page structure
  - **CSS** for styling, layout, and animations
  - **JavaScript** for interactivity and state management
- No backend or database integration
- Optimized for desktop and mobile browsers

---

## 3. Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized folder structure that separates content, styling, logic, and documentation to improve maintainability.

## 4. Main Website Sections

The portfolio consists of the following main sections:

- Navigation Bar  
- Hero Section  
- About Section  
- Projects Section  
- Skills Section  
- Contact Section  


Each section is implemented using semantic HTML elements to enhance readability and accessibility.

---

## 5. Implemented Features

### 5.1 Skills Section with Icons

The Skills section displays technical skills using cards combined with icons.  
An external icon library was integrated to visually represent each skill, which improves clarity and enhances the overall UI compared to plain text.

---

### 5.2 Animated Background

The website includes an animated stars background created using CSS gradients and keyframe animations.  
Initially, the background design was simple, but after reviewing portfolio design examples, this feature was added to make the interface more visually engaging.

The animation logic and visual layering are implemented entirely in the CSS file.

---

### 5.3 Dark and Light Mode Toggle

A Dark/Light mode toggle allows users to switch themes based on their preference.  
The selected theme is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring that the preference persists after page reloads.

This feature improves usability and provides a more comfortable user experience.

---

### 5.4 JavaScript Interactivity

JavaScript is used to handle interactive behavior, including:
- Theme switching
- Button click events
- Dynamic UI updates without reloading the page

The logic is kept simple, readable, and focused on improving user interaction.

## 6. Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used as supportive learning aids rather than direct sources of complete solutions.

They were mainly used for:
- Explaining JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation and event listeners
- Assisting with debugging minor CSS and JavaScript issues
- Providing UI/UX suggestions related to spacing, contrast, and visual balance
- Clarifying how certain features (such as theme toggling) work conceptually

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and adapted.  
The final design, structure, and implementation decisions were made independently.

---

## 7. Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned how to:
- Organize a front-end project using a clear folder structure
- Implement interactive features using JavaScript
- Store and retrieve user preferences using browser storage
- Enhance UI design using CSS animations
- Use AI tools responsibly to support understanding and problem-solving

---

## 8. Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Static content only
- No backend or dynamic data

### Future Enhancements
- Backend integration for dynamic content
- Improved accessibility features
- Additional animations and UI interactions

---

## 9. Conclusion

This portfolio project demonstrates a structured front-end architecture combined with interactive features and thoughtful UI design.  
It reflects my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, as well as my ability to use AI tools responsibly as a learning and support resource.
