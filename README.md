## Short summary of AI use
AI was used as a supportive tool to provide minor suggestions related to UI/UX design, such as color adjustments and small visual improvements. The overall design, structure, and final decisions of the portfolio were entirely my own, with AI suggestions used only to refine and enhance the appearance.

AI was also used occasionally to clarify concepts and help debug issues, understanding code, and learning new techniques, limitedly used in HTML and JavaScript for guidance. Most of the assistance was related to CSS, where small styling suggestions helped improve visual consistency and readability. Details are in ( `ai-usage-report.md`)
